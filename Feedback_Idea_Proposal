This project offers a meaningful contribution to education by identifying key factors influencing students' math performance. However, the proposal could benefit from more details about the practical applications and potential users. For example:

    *Will the system provide actionable recommendations for teachers, students, or policymakers?
    *Could it be used as part of a school dashboard to monitor and improve student outcomes?
    *Will it suggest specific interventions, such as additional resources or tailored teaching methods, based on the predictions?

The project uses common datasets and well-known machine learning techniques, so its uniqueness lies in the insights and applications it delivers. To make it stand out, consider:

    *Incorporating additional datasets or features, such as socioeconomic status, attendance records, or extracurricular activities, to provide a more comprehensive analysis.
    *Highlighting regional or demographic differences in factors influencing math scores to provide localized insights.
    *Exploring how these insights could influence education policy or be integrated into teacher training programs.
Overall, well structured idea proposal. Thank you :)
